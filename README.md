# Bestsellers-categories-Analysis             <br>
This is my first analysis report on the books dataset which i am downloaded from the internet. <br>
Analyst - Rohan Pawar <br>
Date - 9 - 2 - 24  It is the date of uploading of my first ever a project on github. All analysis is done in excel.         <br>
In my analysis, I have to understand the near about 6 columns such as name(name of book), author, user_rating, reviews, price, year and genre. <br>
In the process we can say that user rating from 4.5 to 4.9 are selled more times and have a best reviews by the coustomers. Also in that we taken top 10 authors where sold more books than other.    <br>
And we can easily understand that coustomer prefer high rating books to buy. <br>
