# Bestsellers-categories-Analysis
This is my first analysis report on the books dataset which i am downloaded from the internet. 
Analyst - Rohan Pawar 
Date - 9 - 2 - 24  It is the date of uploading of my first ever a project on github. All analysis is done in excel.
In my analysis, I have to understand the near about 6 columns such as name(name of book), author, user_rating, reviews, price, year and genre.
In the process we can say that user rating from 4.5 to 4.9 are selled more times and have a best reviews by the coustomers. Also in that we taken top 10 authors where sold more books than other.
And we can easily understand that coustomer prefer high rating books to buy.
